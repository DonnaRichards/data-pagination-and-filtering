# Data Pagination and Filtering
TeamTreeHouse Full Stack Javascript TechDegree Project #2

A responsive website showing information for a provided dataset of students.   Student data is broken into multiple pages (nine students per page).  Search function 
included (which was the "extra credit" portion of the project) which displays updates results immediately on detection of update of the search text or 
when the search button is clicked.

Project requirements as stated:
In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

You'll start with a file that contains information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. You'll start by using your JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then you will add navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.

Your application will need to work with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of 42 students. This means your solutions need to be flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.

For this project, you will want to write your code using plain JavaScript, sometimes known as “vanilla” JavaScript. Avoid using jQuery or any other libraries, plugins, or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including the pagination.
